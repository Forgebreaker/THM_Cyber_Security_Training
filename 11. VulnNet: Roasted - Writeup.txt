        [?] Kerberos is a network authentication protocol commonly used in Windows environments for secure authentication between clients and servers. 
            It provides a mechanism for mutual authentication and encryption of communication.

            "vulnnet-rst.local" and the site is "Default-First-Site-Name". The domain represents the logical grouping of network resources, 
            while the site represents a physical or logical grouping of Active Directory domain controllers that are geographically or administratively related.

        [>>] However, some user accounts may be configured to not require pre-authentication, allowing attackers to attempt offline password attacks.

    [?] When pre-authentication is enabled, the client must encrypt a timestamp with their password and include it in the initial Authentication Service Request (AS-REQ) to the Key Distribution Center (KDC) server
        
        [Note] just like the lab "brute force token" I did before =((
